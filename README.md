These datasets support the implementation in R of the software PACTA
(Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment), which is a free tool
that calculates the alignment between financial assets and climate
scenarios (<https://2degrees-investing.org/>). Financial institutions
use PACTA to study how their capital allocation impacts the climate.
Because both financial institutions and market data providers keep their
data private, this package provides fake, public data to enable the
development and use of PACTA in R.

## Installation

Before you install r2dii.analysis you may want to:

  - [Try an rstudio.cloud project with this package already
    installed](https://rstudio.cloud/project/1424833).
  - [Learn how to minimize installation
    errors](https://gist.github.com/maurolepore/a0187be9d40aee95a43f20a85f4caed6#installation).

When you are ready, install the released version of r2dii.data from CRAN
with:

``` r
install.packages("r2dii.data")
```

Or install the development version of r2dii.data with something like
this:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
